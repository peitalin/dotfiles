"""A "native" IPython R kernel in 15 lines of code.

This isn't a real native R kernel, just a quick and dirty hack to get the
basics running in a few lines of code.

Put this into your startup directory for a profile named 'rkernel' or somesuch,
and upon startup, the kernel will imitate an R one by simply prepending `%%R`
to every cell.
